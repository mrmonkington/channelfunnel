Channel Funnel
==============

A simple news aggregator that n-gram clusters stories and presents them
in a simple, infinite-scroll view.  Written in Python using Django and
a few other bits.

Designed to work with news feeds from gaming sites, so some of the
normalisation is tailored to that kind of content.

    - feedparser
