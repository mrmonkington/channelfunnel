			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rumors surrounding next-gen consoles continue to dominate the news today, with a source telling Edge that Ubisoft Montreal already has a dev-kit in-house for Xbox 360&#8242;s successor.</p>
<p><span id="more-216104"></span></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-191343" title="ubisoft-swirl" src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/08/ubisoft-swirl.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="190" /></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/news/next-generation-arrive-2012">According to the anonymous source</a>, dev-kits are to be shipped out to more studios by Christmas, with EA already in possession of one in addition to the Assassin&#8217;s Creed studio.</p>
<p>Ubisoft is rumored to be working with &#8220;target boxes&#8221; running custom software and components from Microsoft, with further rumors claiming AMD-branded GPUs are running the boxes.</p>
<p>In a statement given to Edge, a Ubisoft spokesperson said: &#8220;We do not comment on rumour and speculation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next Xbox console <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/14/report-next-gen-xbox-announcement-for-ces-hex-core-cpu-inside/">was rumored for a CES 2012</a> reveal yesterday.</p>
<p>Last month, four Microsoft employees listed work on next-gen systems on their<a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/10/10/four-ms-employees-working-on-xbox-next-gen-says-linkedin-cvs/"> LinkedIn resumes</a>, and Kinect creative director Kudo Tsunoda was last night revealed to have assembled a team tentatively called the &#8220;NextGen team at MS&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rumors that <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/10/04/rumour-rare-working-on-mature-next-gen-xbox-game-lionhead-and-turn-10-also-making-titles/">Microsoft-owned studios</a> Lionhead, Turn 10, Rare, and 343 Industries are working on games for the next console have also swirled around of late, with the later <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/13/343-puts-down-rumours-of-next-gen-halo-4/">denying Â Halo 4</a> would be the system&#8217;s launch title.</p>
<p><strong>Major Sony studio working with PS4</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only next-gen rumor today; another Edge source has claimed that one of Sony&#8217;s major studios has &#8220;ceased PlayStation 3 development&#8221; and has <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/10/20/rumour-next-xbox-to-get-e3-2013-unveil-ps4-games-already-in-works/">shifted focus</a> on the console&#8217;s fourth iteration.</p>
<p>The studio is also supposedly involved with the development of the console&#8217;s graphics tech.</p>
<p>The new talk comes at a time when Square Enix&#8217;s has gone public on the current generation of consoles, saying developers have nothing more to accomplish with the tech. It was even announced by the firm&#8217;s technology director that its best talent has moved on to &#8220;something else,&#8221; making it likely the publisher is also working on next-gen tech, especially in light of <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/08/26/square-reveals-new-gaming-engine-luminous/">the announcement</a> of Square&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/10/12/squares-photo-realistic-luminous-tech-demoed/">Luminous Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Epic Games has also started work on an enhanced version of Unreal Engine 3, which will be shown during GDC in March 2012. However, if an Unreal Engine 4 is to be released, the firm want it <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/10/26/epic-wants-unreal-engine-4-to-release-closer-next-gen-launch-than-unreal-engine-3/">to launch alongside</a> the next wave of consoles, not beforehand.</p>
<p>While the old adage of where there&#8217;s smoke there&#8217;s fire might ring true in this case, it&#8217;s still best to take everything with a grain of salt until something more concrete emerges, especially as the majority of <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/05/quick-quotes-hayashi-theres-not-a-great-need-anytime-soon-for-next-gen-consoles/">developers</a> <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/08/getting-more-out-of-360-is-a-matter-of-code-magic-time-and-effort-says-bleszinski/">are still keen</a> on <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/07/levine-current-hardware-still-has-a-tonne-of-juice/">current-generation consoles</a>, and both <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/05/06/rumor-source-claims-ea-developer-has-new-xbox-console-tech-in-hand/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/06/09/sony-a-lot-more-headroom-left-in-ps3-says-its-not-slipping-behind-the-times/">Sony</a> have 10-year plans in place for Xbox 360 and PS3.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Will Wright&#8217;s next game has been confirmed as as HiveMind, which is also the name of the new Berkeley, California based startup from the industry vet.</p>
<p><span id="more-216088"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-216093" title="willwright" src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/11/willwright.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="190" /></p>
<p>Speaking in an exclusive <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/11/16/will-wright-hivemind/#.TsPTTEyJZrE.facebook">interview with VentureBeat</a>, Wright explained HiveMind as a game which can customize itself to the individual, using the playerâs real-life as elements.</p>
<p>In more layman terms, the game monitors the player and its routines, and incorporates what it has learned into &#8220;a form of game play.&#8221; It does this by mining data such as the current location of the player and their friends, how much money they have on-hand, etcetera. The game will then direct the person to the right place where they could enjoy themselves, based on their interests.</p>
<p>Wright admitted it sounds a bit like an invasion of privacy, but he feels there is an entertainment value in sharing, and people, especially younger generations which are more comfortable sharing there interests with the world, will gladly fork the information over.</p>
<p>Once enough data is collected on a lot of different people, Wright said it could also turn into sort of a &#8220;matchmaking service&#8221; and by discovering useful and entertaining things about the players.</p>
<p>âIt blurs entertainment, lifestyle, and personal tools,â he said. &#8220;With that data, the world and the opportunities for entertainment within it become more visible to you. If we can learn enough about the player, we can create games about their real life. How do we get you more engaged in reality rather than distract you from it?</p>
<p>âThis has to do with where gaming is going. We had our eras in console gaming and social gaming. A lot of this personal gaming will happen on mobile devices. The question here is how can we learn enough about the player to create games about his or her real life.â</p>
<p>Wright said he doesn&#8217;t want the game &#8220;limited&#8221; by information such as location data, as in order to go deeper into the player, HiveMind will use gaming psychology as well to find out what motivates the player to perform certain actions; games will allow HiveMind to actually mine data regarding the individual, not the gaming populous at large. This is where the player becomes the game.</p>
<p>HiveMind won&#8217;t limit players based on location either, like some Augmented Reality titles, and players can call upon their friends to help with their needs and help will accomplishing goals you want to achieve in real life. Wright described it as crowdsourcing, which allows many to contribute to one, singleÂ problemÂ or issue which the internet isÂ renownedÂ for.</p>
<p>âWhen you look at the arc of the games I have done, starting from SimCity, they are each mining a deeper level of creativity,â Wright said. âAnd they are more focused on the individual over time.â</p>
<p>HiveMind&#8217;s release and platform availability will be revealed at a later date, but Wright is looking towards mobile and Facebook at the moment, with theÂ possibilityÂ of an eventual console release. It may even interact with a TV show he has in the works with Stupid Fun Club.</p>
<p>His hope with HiveMind, is that it &#8220;triggers interest&#8221; from Â other developers considering the same type of game, in order to &#8220;scale up&#8221; the businessÂ incorporating large pockets of talent working onÂ apps, system back-ends, and anything which would make HiveMind &#8220;a reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>âWe want to do this in a very big way,â Wright said.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bethesda&#8217;s announced it&#8217;s sold 3.5 million units of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in the game&#8217;s opening 48 hours on sale.</p>
<p><span id="more-216085"></span><img src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/08/skyrimtesv-aug.jpg" alt="" title="skyrimtesv-aug" width="668" height="190" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-198855" /></p>
<p>The publisher confirmed it shipped 7 million units for launch, adding it expects to see $450 million in sales.</p>
<p>The sales number wasn&#8217;t mentioned in the press release, but it does say that &#8220;more than 50% of launch units were sold in the first 48 hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over 280,000 concurrent players were playing it on Steam within its first 24 hours, far more than any other game on the service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without a doubt, this has been our most ambitious project ever,&#8221; said Bethesda Game Studios director Todd Howard. &#8220;After over three years of development, we&#8217;re finally excited to get it into everyone&#8217;s hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Altman, CEO of ZeniMax Media added: &#8220;Todd Howard and his team at Bethesda Game Studios have crafted a very special game. Anticipation for Skyrim has surpassed any game in our company&#8217;s history, and we are pleased that sales and reviews have reflected the quality and hours of amazing gameplay it provides.&#8221;</p>
<p>The RPG launched last Friday worldwide for PC, PS3 and 360. The 360 version will get the first two packs of DLC as part of a timed exclusivity deal.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Junction Head boss Warren Spector has teased the studio&#8217;s upcoming future projects, promising &#8220;surprises&#8221;.</p>
<p><span id="more-216079"></span><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-149635" title="20110218epicmickey2" src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/02/20110218epicmickey2.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="190" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell you Iâm really excited about future projects from Junction Point. Thereâll certainly be some surprises. Beyond that, youâre gettingâ nothinâ outta me,&#8221; Spector told <a href="http://www.industrygamers.com/news/game-industry-legends-warren-spector/" target="_new">IndustryGamers</a> in a short quote.</p>
<p>The Deus Ex and Epic Mickey creator also noted that the evolution of social games is &#8220;changing games in all sorts of ways, some good, some bad,&#8221; adding it would be &#8220;inevitable that social and mobile will be a big part of our gaming future.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued: &#8220;On the plus side, these two game platforms or styles are growing the audience for gaming. There are so many more people interested in interactive entertainment now than there were before social and mobile came along.</p>
<p>&#8220;Playing games has become so commonplace the word &#8216;gamer&#8217; seems almost anachronistic, if not unnecessary. On the downside, social and mobile have changed expectations of game costs â both for developers making games and consumers playing them.&#8221;</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156851" title="gamelogo" src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/03/gamelogo.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="190" /></p>
<p>According to management statement released this morning <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/326216/game-reports-sales-decline-overall-market-very-challenging/?cid=OTC-RSS&amp;attr=CVG-General-RSS">via CVG</a>, GAME and Gamestation sales were down 10.6%, but still a few percentages ahead of the overall market, which declined 12.3% in the same period.</p>
<p>&#8220;The performance of the market is below our expectations,&#8221; said GAME CEO Ian Shepherd in a statement. &#8220;Major software titles are launching in line with first week expectations, but are then seeing a quicker tail-off than historically experienced. Customer footfall and basket sizes are down reflecting wider consumer uncertainty.</p>
<p>&#8220;The overall video games market remains very challenging, despite strong title launches, and our guidance today reflects the extraordinary economic times in which we are operating. GAME has outperformed the market, reinforcing our position as market leader, and I am hugely proud of our teams. &#8221;</p>
<p>Revenues from videogame sales in the UK last week <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/14/uk-charts-mw3-goes-top-sees-less-first-week-sales-then-black-ops/">were the largest on record</a>, according to GfK ChartTrack, with Modern Warfare 3&#8242;s debut contributing to a massive Â£120.8 million in sales.</p>

Users who have a faulty discs claim that either the game isn&#8217;t read from the console or it does boot up only to crash soon after. One user claims that Microsoft and Activision are &#8220;well aware of the problem and are trying to fix it and might release an update for this later,&#8221; according to a conversation they had with an Xbox support rep.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BioWare has said beta testers logged over 1 million hours in Star Wars: The Old Republic last weekend, with tens of thousands participating.</p>
<p><span id="more-216068"></span><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-205548" title="swtor-sithPB" src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/09/swtor-sithPB.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="190" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-11-16-swtor-had-over-1m-hours-of-testing-last-weekend">Speaking with Eurogamer</a>, studio founders Greg Zeschuk and Ray Muzyka said that, at present, the game is &#8220;largely where we want it to be,&#8221; but the mood around the Austin studio is still &#8220;very measured&#8221; as launch day looms near.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not panicky. I just came from Austin,&#8221; said Zeschuk. &#8220;It&#8217;s very measured. It is coming soon. The game is largely where we want to be. It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re trying to jam anything in in the last minute. We&#8217;re trying to finish everything off to the level we&#8217;re satisfied with.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s really important is it&#8217;s stable and reliable and doesn&#8217;t crash all of the time. If you put a whole bunch of stuff in right at the end it makes it less stable, so we&#8217;re controlling the end. This is how we finish most games. What we do is, early on in development the pipe is really big. Anyone can put stuff into the game and then we narrow it and narrow it and narrow it. Now we&#8217;re in this narrow pipe phase where stuff is still going in, but it&#8217;s being carefully measured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Against that we&#8217;re testing. This weekend we had a big test &#8211; tens upon tens of thousands. One crazy number is we had over 1 million hours of testing over the weekend. It was a huge test, and there are even bigger ones coming. The key thing is for us to take those learnings, apply them and make the service really stable. We&#8217;re happy with the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>The main goal for BioWare is to ensure a smooth launch for the MMO, and with more testing planned via an open beta on a weekend yet to be determined by the developer, the company is staying &#8220;cautiously optimistic&#8221; regarding both server and game stability.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to serve our players really well,&#8221; said Muzyka. &#8220;We want to serve them with a great, stable, secure, high quality experience. That&#8217;s our goal. We&#8217;re doing everything we can.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a massive undertaking to make sure we figure out everything that could possibly go wrong and trying our best. The team is working their asses off. They&#8217;re passionate about serving our fans and making this great for them. They&#8217;re working long hours and through the weekends to make sure they get every minute of testing they possibly can and fix every issue they find. They&#8217;re doing well. I&#8217;m proud of them. They&#8217;re working hard and they&#8217;re doing a great job.&#8221;</p>
<p>As previously stated by both BioWare and EA, the availability of the game will be limited, and not sold &#8220;beyond a certain point&#8221; in order to ensure stability. More copies of the games will be sold based on general reliability, but that dial will be turned &#8220;carefully,&#8221; added Muzyka.</p>
<p>SWTOR is slated for a December 20 release.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nolan North is of the opinion Ubisoft should adopt the same motion capture process for its Assassin&#8217;s Creed series as Naughty Dog uses with the Uncharted franchise.</p>
<p><span id="more-215823"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215827" title="asscreedrev1115" src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/11/asscreedrev1115.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="190" /></p>
<p>Speaking in an interview <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/326067/nolan-north-urges-assassins-creed-to-adopt-uncharted-mo-cap-theres-absolutely-a-difference/?cid=OTC-RSS&amp;attr=CVG-General-RSS">with CVG</a>, North, who provides the voice of Desmond in the series, feels there&#8217;s a bit of a &#8220;disconnect&#8221; in the motion capture methods used: voice actors provide facial animation while body capture is recorded by separate actors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish it wasn&#8217;t done separately,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the mo-cap actors do a great job, but there will always be somewhat of a disconnect when it&#8217;s done this way. After my experiences on the Uncharted franchise, where the actors do both performance and voice, I can honestly say there is absolutely a difference.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cut-scenes are shot exactly like a film or television program. The actors interact more naturally and unique and subtle elements to the performances are captured. Don&#8217;t think for a minute that gamers don&#8217;t notice. They&#8217;re a savvy bunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>North has stated before, that switching to full performance capture in the Uncharted series made a huge difference in &#8220;realistic quality&#8221; of the games.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first game, we would do the mo-cap and then have to go back in and do ADR ourselves,&#8221; <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/01/nolan-north-were-not-here-to-half-ass-it/">he told IGN at the time</a>. &#8220;Now we have our own mo-cap studio. I think it makes a difference with the focus. You can&#8217;t be as lazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Revelations was is out today in the US and on Friday in the UK. Hit up reviews for the game <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/14/assassins-creed-revelations-reviews-start-hitting/">through here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starbreeze CEO Mikael Nermark has said the studio is working on a PSN game.</p>
<p><span id="more-216023"></span><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-159312" title="starbreeze" src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/03/starbreeze.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="190" /></p>
<p>Speaking to PSM3 (via <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/326213/interviewsstarbreeze-ceo-i-see-myself-as-a-janitor-more-than-anything-else/" target="_new">CVG</a>), he admitted the Swedish studio was working on something smaller alongside Syndicate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are actually doing it. Right now,&#8221; Nermark said, adding the title was &#8220;a self-financed thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding PSN in general, Nermark noted studios &#8220;have to understand how to utilise the new medium, so to speak, and understand that we have to build a game for the PSN instead of trying to do a big game.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s the hardest part for us &#8211; to adjust when we&#8217;re doing the small stuff. Because as a studio, we think big.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t be that big when we&#8217;re making a PSN game. A big game can be anything between 120-200 staff, whereas a small project is one tenth of that, so you have to be able to understand how you handle your resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>The studio&#8217;s bigger project, Syndicate, launches next February for PS3, 360 and PC.</p>

<p><span id="more-216018"></span><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-172820" title="trenched" src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/05/trenched.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="190" /></p>
<p>Muir, the game&#8217;s director, dropped the news in a statement to <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/news/double-fine-laments-unfortunate-iron-brigade-delay" target="_new">XBLAFans</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we could announce dates. We&#8217;re getting really close to having it clear certification through Microsoft and it&#8217;s kind of unfortunate because changing the name of a game you&#8217;ve already shipped in half the world is a lot harder than I thought it would be,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many different departments that it has to cruise through at Microsoft in order to enable the name change. It&#8217;s pretty ridiculous. They sent us the preliminary plan on how that [was] going to work and I didn&#8217;t even know there were that many divisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>It comes as the game, which has already released in the US, had to<a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/09/12/trenched-to-take-iron-brigade-rename-worldwide/"> change its name from Trenched to Iron Brigade following a trademark dispute</a> with the creator of a board game which carries the name Trench.</p>
<p>Iron Brigade was promised to have a September release, <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/08/16/ms-play-day-trenched-becomes-iron-brigade-for-eu-release-more/">as announced</a> at Microsoft&#8217;s Play Day at gamescom in August, but has since gone off the radar.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Revelations&#8217; reviews on Monday showing a noticeable shock of 7s, should Assassin&#8217;s Creed take a break after next year&#8217;s game? Probably, says Johnny Cullen.</p>
<p><span id="more-215826"></span><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215996" title="acrec2" src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/11/acrec2.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="190" /></p>

<h3>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</h3>
<p><img src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/10/ac-revelations.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Assassin&#8217;s Creed was originally announced at E3 2006 as a PS3 exclusive, before eventually making the jump to 360 and PC.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a yearly AC release since Assassin&#8217;s Creed II in 2009.</p>
<p>Main titles &#8211; AC1, ACII, Brotherhood &#8211; have sold 28 million units as of May this year.</p>
<p>Revelations is Ezio and Altair&#8217;s final story chapter, but Desmond&#8217;s story will continue.</p>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;m an Assassin&#8217;s Creed fan. While the 2007 original got its fair share of kickings, I gave it its due for being a decent game. It would be silly of me to overlook its faults &#8211; and it did have a fair few of them, like bugs, glitches, repetitiveness &#8211; but the potential was there.</p>
<p>That potential was realised two years ago with Assassin&#8217;s Creed II. The sequel was such a turnaround. Jade Raymond, Patrice DÃ©silets and their team at Ubisoft Montreal &#8211; mostly comprised of members of the original group behind the PS2 Prince of Persia trilogy &#8211; had fixed the mistakes of AC1 and, while it wasn&#8217;t perfect, it was in my top three games of 2009, behind Uncharted 2 and the Beatles: Rock Band.</p>
<p>Then, along came Brotherhood, which continued Ezio&#8217;s story. Did it need to? Probably not. Yes, ACII left on a cliffhanger, but so did AC1. It was here fans started to express concern that Ubisoft would go down the yearly route that&#8217;s been tricky for series like Need for Speed or Guitar Hero. It was the thought that Brotherhood, at least before release, should have been some sort of expansion for Assassin&#8217;s Creed II.</p>
<p>And yet, for all the worries, Brotherhood paid off for Ubisoft. It was a fully-fledged game that introduced multiplayer. Despite concerns, Ubi Montreal found ways to fit the narrative around it. If the story was about Desmond, Ezio and the Assassins, multiplayer could tie into Abstergo and the Templars. In a world of tack-on multiplayer, the game was rightly praised.</p>
<p><strong>Revelatory?</strong></p>
<p>But when Revelations started bringing in several in-house developers alongside Ubisoft Montreal, it could have been seen as a first sign of trouble. Ubisoft Annecy<br />
Ubisoft Massive, Ubisoft Quebec, Ubisoft Singapore and Ubisoft Bucharest all helped with development. It shocked me to see the amount of studios coming up in the opening credits of the game. It&#8217;s worth noting that BioShock 2 went the same way, with 2K Marin the main dev being helped by five other studios, including the now Bethesda-owned Arkane.</p>
<p>Some of the feature additions this time also rang alarm bells. Is tower defence necessary, or just fishing for &#8220;something else&#8221;? A nice addition in theory, but it seems ridiculous to have Ezio, a character suited for open world exploratory, rooted to a rooftop. It&#8217;s a bit off. My personal experience of this wasn&#8217;t the best.</p>
<p class="quote left">When you have six studios working on one single game, it&#8217;s time to take stock. For a series like Assassin&#8217;s Creed, it breaks my heart to say that.</p>
<p>Bombcrafting is probably the nicest addition to Revelations, but can be ignored despite the game basically begging you to take time out and make explosives. As good as it may be, you&#8217;re basically crafting grenades. <em>Hand grenades</em>. What else do you need to know about it? You pick your shell, then your ingredients to determine what kind of &#8216;bomb&#8217; you want to make. Lethal? Non-lethal?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong; credit should go to Ubisoft for trying new things. It&#8217;s partly that reason that allowed Brotherhood to work so well. But I can&#8217;t help feel there&#8217;s too much unnecessary stuff here even for Assassin&#8217;s Creed fans to accept. In fact, it&#8217;s logical to believe that all these additions, and the story, could have worked better as a big DLC for Brotherhood, <em>Ã  la</em> GTA IV, with the next full game being Assassin&#8217;s Creed III.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t finished Revelation, but so far 7/10 feels right. Eurogamer, Wired, Edge and Destructoid <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/14/assassins-creed-revelations-reviews-start-hitting/">all scored it in the 7s range this week</a>. So far, Ezio&#8217;s grand farewell may just be a farewell, plain and simple. I want Revelations to come back and turn around my initial impression, but it&#8217;s impossible to ignore the feeling that the series is turning down a slippery path from which it may not be able to return. We&#8217;re not at that stage yet, but it&#8217;s getting closer each year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/10/03/assassins-creed-desmonds-story-to-wrap-up-by-december-2012-says-revelations-creative-boss/">Ubisoft&#8217;s already confirmed a new game for next year</a>, which will end Desmond&#8217;s story arc, and I can only hope that finishing Ezio and Altair&#8217;s story this year will help creatively with 2012&#8242;s release. But what comes after that? If the following year isn&#8217;t Assassin&#8217;s Creed III, Ubisoft needs to take a break. Plain and simple.</p>
<p>Assassin&#8217;s Creed may now be Ubisoft&#8217;s biggest cash earner, but it wasn&#8217;t made to be a yearly franchise in a similar vein Call of Duty. While multiple studios are working on CoD&#8217;s yearly installments &#8211; such as Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer &#8211; you only have Ubisoft Montreal working on main AC installments.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to my initial point of bringing in those five in-house studios to help out on Revelations. When you have six studios working on one single game, it&#8217;s time to take stock.</p>
<p>And for a series like Assassin&#8217;s Creed, it breaks my heart to say that.</p>
<p><em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Revelations is available now for PS3 and 360.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Piranha Bytes doesn&#8217;t let players have access to the ships in Risen 2: Dark Waters straight off the bat, in order to keep them from being overhwlemed by the world&#8217;s size.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/11/20111116risen2.jpg" alt="" title="20111116risen2" width="668" height="190" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215978" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to go out to sea to create an exotic and tropical pirate game,&#8221; Piranha Bytes&#8217; BjÃ¶rn Pankratz said of the unusual decision to include seafaring in the game.</p>
<p>The designer explained that players begin with a tutorial on a small island which is overrun by monsters, before traveling to a larger one with two settlements. Shortly afterwards, the game&#8217;s scope opens out dramatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you join the pirates you can reach the coast over here by ship,&#8221; he said, indicating the other side of the map.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you get to command your own ship, so you can travel to the other islands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the usual struggle of making it neither too big nor too small. On the one hand, you&#8217;ve got to create a world big enough to make it plausible that you require a ship. On the other hand if it&#8217;s too big it gets boring.&#8221; colleague Michael Hoge added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We used the islands to put certain structures in place. At the start, players are told to go to island A, and Island B &#8211; then suddenly, you get your ship, and you can get to island C, D, E anf F in any order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Piranha Bytes used a terrain engine for the first time, as the size of the game world made hand crafting landscapes &#8211; and the accompanying headaches that result from small manual adjustments &#8211; impractical.</p>
<p>Risen 2 is scheduled to release on PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 some time in 2012. Watch the full developer diary below.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Games has no plans to patch the PSN version of Joe Danger to bring it inline with the <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/03/joe-danger-special-edition-confirmed-for-xbla/" target="_blank" >Xbox Live-exclusive Special Edition</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-215968"></span></p>
<p><img src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/11/20111116joedanger.jpg" alt="" title="20111116joedanger" width="668" height="190" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215969" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The changes we&#8217;ve made &#8211; and I think people will understand when they&#8217;ve played the Special Edition &#8211; change the game in ways that I think would be really weird for us to bring over to PSN,&#8221; Hello Games head Sean Murray  told <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-11-15-why-joe-danger-special-edition-tweaks-are-360-exclusive" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve removed levels we just didn&#8217;t like. It might be someone&#8217;s favourite level, and it would just disappear. We&#8217;ve made certain things easier and certain things harder. We&#8217;ve changed the way certain things unlock. So someone would be half way through and just go, &#8216;Oh, I thought I had that level unlocked and now it&#8217;s locked again.&#8217; It&#8217;s impractical to do that. We can&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people when they port a game they just do that &#8211; it&#8217;s literally exactly the same. That went against&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t do that. It would be very boring. We took it on as a creative, fun thing to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Re-releasing the game also gives Hello the chance to rectify issues disallowed by the original&#8217;s time and budgetary constraints.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had kind of run out of time and money and were like &#8216;we have to release this game&#8217;, which is a terrible thing to admit to. You do get to that stage when you have to get it out there,&#8221; Murray said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what has been nice &#8211; that we had unfinished business and we get to come back for a Special Edition and change quite a lot of things and make things right. I guess people are going to get angry and say &#8216;why don&#8217;t we have those changes in our version&#8217;, but I think it&#8217;s the right thing to do, to fix those problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe Danger originally released as a PlayStation Network exclusive. The Special Edition, which will arrive only on Xbox Live Arcade, has not yet been dated.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trade organisation UK Interactive Entertainment has called out the British government for its failure to follow through on plans to adopt the PEGI system of games content rating.</p>
<p><span id="more-215965"></span></p>
<p><img src="http://images.vg247.com/current//2011/08/20110811pegi.jpg" alt="" title="20110811pegi" width="668" height="190" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-193245" /></p>
<p>&#8220;This further delay to PEGI&#8217;s implementation is extremely frustrating not to mention disappointing,&#8221; commented UKIE chairman Andy Payne, as ported by <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-11-15-pegi-implementation-delayed-again" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have received repeated assurances from government that the process is in hand, yet PEGI is still no closer to implementation.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the UKIE, the British government needs to make a Statutory Instrument to introduce PEGI, but has failed to file the paperwork needed to present it to the House of Commons.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government has set its stock by making the UK one of the best places in Europe to do business yet despite industry consistently calling on the government to introduce the necessary measures to reduce the cost of doing business, we have been hit by delay after delay,&#8221; Payne continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that the much talked about red tape has yet again got in the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UK government <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2009/06/16/pegi-is-sole-game-ratings-board-for-uk/">decided to adopt the widely-used PEGI as its sole games rating system</a> in mid 2009, removing the buden currently shouldered by the British Board of Film Classification in a confusing double system.</p>
<p>The system was <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2009/06/19/pegi-ratings-enforcement-expected-to-begin-before-christmas/">expected to be adopted</a> before the end of that year, but <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2010/07/15/vsc-confirms-pegi-ratings-delay-into-2011/">suffered</a> <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/01/13/pegi-implementation-delayed-into-july-at-the-earliest/">numerous</a> <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2011/01/27/pegi-uk-age-rating-implementation-delayed-until-september/">delays</a>.</p>

<p>Upping its tournament support, Epic has added an optional spectator mode to private versus matches. The spectator mode applied to 4v4 matches, with one player from each team nominated as spectator.</p>
<p>Another community-friendly tweak allows players to disable the HUD &#8211; perfect for making videos.</p>
<p>On the multiplayer side, fans will be either delighted or devastated to learn of the following exploit fixes, depending on whether they&#8217;ve been handing it out or taking it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Onyx Field Engineer medal can no longer be prestiged.</li>
<li>In Capture the Leader, the overhead Beams on DryDock are no longer accessible.</li>
<li>While affected by the Smoke Grenade stun, players will no longer be able to take hostages, pick up weapons or revive teammates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the full <a href="http://epicgames.com/community/2011/11/gears-of-war-3-title-update-2-release-notes/" target="_blank">patch notes</a> for more details.</p>
