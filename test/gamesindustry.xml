Bethesda's fantasy epic The Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim has sold 3.5 million copies globally in just 48 hours.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The publisher shipped 7 million copies for launch and reported that 50 per cent of those copies sold in within two days. It's expecting worldwide retail sales from launch units of around $450 million.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"We are grateful for the fans' response to Skyrim," said ZeniMax Media CEO Robert Altman.

Birmingham City Council is looking for developers to build a game for mobiles and tablets that will bring new users to the Library Of Birmingham.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"When the new Library of Birmingham opens in 2013 it will provide people with much greater access to both our world-class collections and services - both online and via the magnificent new building on Centenary Square as well," said Birmingham City Council leader Mike Whitby.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"This gaming experience is an exciting opportunity for us to embrace state-of-the-art technologies and attract new audiences to the internationally important collections and extensive content of the new Library. We are looking for a company who will work creatively with us to create an exciting gaming experience which will be as ground-breaking as the new Library."

Shadows Of The Damned developer Grasshopper Manufacture has launched a new initiative to support students working in PlayStation Vita development, and may even publish some of the finished projects as downloads.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Eight schools are involved in the scheme, including Kyoto Seika University, HAL Osaka and Trident Computer College, and aims to "discover the next generation of talent." 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Updates are available on the new Japanese Sony Play Community site, where there's an official group for the project.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Two of Capcom's biggest franchises have been made available to buy on EA's Origin service, with SSFIV Arcade Edition and Dead Rising 2: Off the Record available to purchase now.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
EA announced last month that it would be bringing third-party games from THQ, Warner Bros. and Capcom to the service.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Both games are currently available in the US for $39.99 each. No date has been given for the rest of the world.

				 GAME: Total group sales down ten percent</title><link>http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-16-game-total-sales-down-ten-percent</link><pubDate>16 November 2011 08:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-16-game-total-sales-down-ten-percent</guid><description>
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The GAME Group released its latest financial interim statement today, showing a 8.6 per cent drop in like for like sales and a 10.6 per cent drop in total group sales over the 41 week period up to November 12, suggesting that the UK's high street retailers are still facing tough times.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
All categories of product have seen revenue fall, and even major game releases are seeing a big drop off after the initial launch week, with catalogue sales dropping. Online sales remained stable, with market share holding at 19 per cent.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
28 per cent of total sales are now coming from the second hand market, which operates at a 40 per cent margin.

									&lt;/p&gt;

				 Tech Focus: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</title><link>http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/digitalfoundry-tech-focus-skyrim</link><pubDate>16 November 2011 07:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/digitalfoundry-tech-focus-skyrim</guid><description>
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The notion of consumers as beta testers appears to be growing increasingly commonplace, and it's something of a shame that Skyrim should be getting so much attention for its technical problems when the core package is simply remarkable. In this article, I'll be taking a look at some of Skyrim's most impressive technical achievements, but also highlighting related bugs and issues that are causing concern amongst the userbase. Could they by any chance be related? In some cases, perhaps so.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
As the stack of YouTube bug videos rises seemingly by the hour, the question is, how can complex systems and features be fully tested when the circumstances in which they come into play will almost certainly change between players, and when the behaviour of the gamers themselves is so difficult to anticipate? Just how thorough can conventional QA be when we have a game as vast, open and as wide-ranging as this? 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Make no mistake, despite the game's miniscule size in terms of compressed game data on the shipping DVD, there's no doubting the scale of the game and the sheer scope for adventure it contains. Bethesda's remarkable compression scheme ensures that the entire Xbox 360 version of the game weighs in at just 3.8GB. Never mind that we're now in the era of the 50GB dual layer Blu-ray: the Xbox 360 version of Skyrim in its entirety would fit snugly onto a single layer DVD with space to spare.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
The introduction of PEGI ratings in the UK has been delayed again, meaning that any enforcement of the system is at least 6 months away.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
PEGI ratings were part of the Digital Economy Act passed 18 months ago, but according to UK Interactive Entertainment, the passing of a Statutory Instrument needed to bring the Act into force has not been notified to Europe or put before the House of Commons.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"This further delay to PEGI's implementation is extremely frustrating not to mention disappointing," said UKIE chairman Andy Payne.

US retail giant GameStop isn't waiting for the traditional console lifecycle to come around again - instead it sees smartphones and tablets as hardware central to its second hand business.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
While a new generation of home games consoles have been released roughly every five years, smartphones and tablet releases are updated much quicker, with mobile technology improved every 12-18 months.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"We've seen research that says there's about $8 billion worth of used smartphones, iPod Touches, iPods and even tablets that are in people's homes that they're not using because they've bought the next model," Mike Mauler, executive vice president of GameStop told GamesIndustry.biz.

Activision Blizzard's parent company Vivendi has sold 35 million shares in the publisher at an unknown rate, in a deal which is thought to have raised around $425 million.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Share prices the morning of the sale stood at $12.28 a piece.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Vivendi issued a statement saying that it had no intentions of abandoning the 60 per cent share in the company which it retains.

Ubisoft Reflections' studio head Gareth Edmondson has left the company after more than ten years as part of the team that created the Driver franchise.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The studio was bought by Ubisoft in 2006, and most recently worked on the well-received Driver: San Francisco. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"In the five years since Reflections has become a part of the Ubisoft team of studios, we have had the pleasure of working and creating together with Gareth Edmondson as head of Reflections. Gareth has made the choice to leave the studio at this time," said Ubisoft in a statement.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
A Korean MMO has been taken permanently offline after the game's data was deleted during essential server maintenance last month.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
M2, run by developer Sankando and operator Hangame, was taken offline on the 21 October to deal with a widespread data problem, reports IgxPro.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
During the server maintenance which ensued, vital information was deleted from the game's database which could not be restored and had not been backed up externally or elsewhere. 

									&lt;/p&gt;

Four winning teams have been selected from the contestants at the Epic Game Jam, a 48 competition to create an iOS title with the Unreal Development Kit, sponsored by Train2Game.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The teams were selected from over 100 competitors at the event at Bradford University which took place from 4-6 November. The winners can now contend the next stage of the event at the Gadget Show Live in April next year for a grand prize of a commercial UDK licence for iOS.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
All entries had to share a common theme relating to Guy Fawkes. First placed in the competition were The A-Team, with a side-scrolling adventure in a 17th Century town, whilst runners up prizes went to Nova Eye and Team Gandalf.

Min-Liang Tan, the CEO of gaming hardware manufacturer Razer, has called for the return of two laptop prototypes that were stolen from the company's offices.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Tan issued the plea to Razer's Facebook community, explaining that the prototype Blade laptops were taken after a "break-in" at the company's San Francisco research lab on November 4.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"As you can imagine, the return of these prototype units is very important to the company," he said. "We have already reported this to the authorities who are working closely with us on this matter."

									&lt;p&gt;
										
The company offers a range of e-commerce services, based around micro-transactions and the sale of virtual goods, to a network of around 48 million users.

				 Facebook: We're offering 100 million niche audiences</title><link>http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-15-facebook-were-offering-100-million-niche-audiences</link><pubDate>15 November 2011 08:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-15-facebook-were-offering-100-million-niche-audiences</guid><description>
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The growth in gaming on Facebook now means that the social network is offering up niche audiences of up to 100 million users, according to games boss Gareth Davis.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Speaking in an exclusive interview published today on GamesIndustry.biz, Davies said he over the past 18 months games developers have begun to serve the hardcore gaming market in an environment that was recently just considered a casual audience. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"We have so many users now on Facebook that we can have really big niches. 100 million user niches. We see the emergence now of companies on Facebook who are building what they'd call a core game. Games targeted at people who played PC games back in the day, strategy games," he said.

				 Helgason: Windows Phone 7 too closed for Unity</title><link>http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-15-helgason-windows-phone-7-too-closed-for-unity</link><pubDate>15 November 2011 08:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-15-helgason-windows-phone-7-too-closed-for-unity</guid><description>
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Unity CEO David Helgason has said that his company's game engine will never find its way onto Windows Phone 7 - because of the closed nature of the system.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Speaking to Develop, Helgason explained that any app or program which runs on the platform must be developed in either XNA or a bespoke version of Microsoft's Silverlight, which would be possible for Unity, but require too much work to be worthwhile.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Describing the platform as: "a relatively closed system so you can't run native content, which means we can't really support it," Helagson went on to say that, "we're looking at Windows Phone 8 and hopefully it will be easier to work on that system." 

									&lt;/p&gt;

				 A Face in the Crowd</title><link>http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-14-face-in-the-crowd-interview</link><pubDate>15 November 2011 08:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-14-face-in-the-crowd-interview</guid><description>
									&lt;p&gt;
										For some people Facebook is a collection of 500 million people, all shouting about what they've done today and trying to get you to harvest their zucchinis for you. For others it's the thoughts and interests of all of your closest friends and family, a place to share experiences and keep abreast of the lives of loved ones you're not lucky enough to see very often. But for Facebook, it's all business.
									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										Whichever side of the divide you're on, it's hard to deny Facebook's massive impact on the development and future of the games industry. The driving force behind the social and casual gaming revolution, Facebook has birthed Zynga, given new life to Bejewelled and made farmers out of millions of us. Facebook has been a game changer.
									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										So what's next? GamesIndustry.biz sat down with Gareth Davis, head of the Facebook games platform, to find out what's in store ahead of his keynote at Evolve in London this December.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
It may be well overdue, but Ian Livingstone has revealed that recent developments should mean the formal Government response to his Skills Review will be "more positive" than the industry was "previously expecting". 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz, the Eidos life president said: "I can confirm that the delay in the Government's response to Next Gen is for a good reason."

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Whilst he would not elaborate further, it is believed that comments made last week by the Prime Minister have given the industry's case renewed momentum in anticipation of the official statement from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. 

									&lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Yahoo Japan has launched its own marketplace for Android apps and games, a move which could further fragment the platform's marketplace.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The portal provides reviews and ratings, and currently links through to the official Google-operated site for app downloads. As of Spring next year, however, Yahoo will be hosting those apps, and operating a payment system for them, itself.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Several other companies have already launched their own versions of the Android marketplace around the world - a natural progression of Google's 'hands-off' policy which has seen it accused by some of failing to properly cultivate Android as a platform.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Capy Games president Nathan Vella has warned developers against targeting a mass audience on iOS, Gamasutra reports.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
In a talk at GDC China, Vella claimed that the success of Capy's Sword and Sorcery EP - which sold 300,000 units in its first six months on sale - was down to clear and thorough targeting of a niche audience.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"What we did was do exactly the opposite of what you're supposed to do when you make an iOS game," he said, explaining that the rapid growth of the iOS market has led to the erroneous idea that a mass market focus is the best path to success.

Microsoft's Brian Prince has described Onlive and Gaikai as models for the future of cloud gaming, Gamasutra reports.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
In a talk at GDC China, Prince, a "cloud evangelist" for Microsoft, claimed that these nascent services provide an instructive roadmap for where gaming is headed. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"These are really gaming platforms as a service," he said. "There are some limitations here, but I really do think this is the distant future of gaming in the cloud."

Core videogames has been an uneven time for Disney of late, with Epic Mickey underperforming and UK studio Black Rock suffering sudden closure. However, one area that is safe for the House of Mouse is Club Penguin, a kid-focused online world that remains big business despite increasing competition from upstarts like Moshi Monsters.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
GamesIndustry.biz spoke to Jeff Jones, Disney's vice president and general manager of Digital Games, about Club Penguin's status within the company as a whole, the rise and threat of mobile and social, and when we can expect to see traditional Disney properties explore similar territory.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
According to sales monitor NPD, total video game sales were up 1 per cent from $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion, with hardware up 6 per cent to $295.6 million and accessories up 3 per cent to $621.3 million.

High Street retailer GAME eventually sees itself as a broker between digital technology companies and consumers, selling contracts to customers rather than physical hardware and software.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
That's the vision of CEO Ian Shepherd, according to consultant Nick Parker, who said the video game specialist intends to model itself on the Carphone Warehouse business.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"With OnLive and GAME it's no coincidence that they're going into business. I sat down with Ian Shepherd a couple of weeks ago and his vision is seeing GAME like Carphone Warehouse, whereby Carphone Warehouse doesn't actually sell anything at all, no product, no hardware, it just sells contracts," he told the London Games Conference.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Nvidia attributed its climbing profits to the emergence of high-end games like Battlefield 3.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
For the quarter ending October 31, the company posted revenue of $1.06 billion, up $843.9 million from the same quarter last year. Net profits were $178.3 million, more than double the previous year's total of $84.9 million.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The majority of the company's revenue - $644.8 million - was generated by its GPU business. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang credited the company's strong financial performance the growing disparity between console and PC performance.

Sony has released a pricing list for its Vita Passport system, which will allow users to download digital versions of their UMD games to play on PlayStation Vita.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Prices for the digital versions of the games appear to range from £4-£12 when converted from the original Yen values. All cost are on top of the original UMD prices.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
To enable the process, gamers will need to register and download the UMD Registration Application to their PSP, insert the UMD they want to register and start the application. That UMD will then be uniquely registered to that account to prevent duplication.

The downloads of the game on Steam, PSN and XBLA have allowed Playdead to buy out the investors that supported it early on.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"With the success that Limbo has achieved, we felt this was the ideal time to fully regain our independence," said CEO Dino Patti.

Zynga CEO Mark Pincus has accused the Wall Street Journal of protraying his company in a "false and skewed light."

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
In an internal memo acquired by the Fortune blog Term Sheet, Pincus addressed a front-page article in the Wall Street Journal that accused him of "giver's remorse" over employee stock options.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"The Wall Street Journal posted a story last night...which paints our meritocracy in a false and skewed light," Pincus stated. "The story is based on hearsay and innuendo, which is disappointing but is to be expected as we move towards becoming a public company."

The Disney Interactive Media Group was the only division of the Walt Disney Company to make a loss this financial year.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Despite the company beating analysts estimates on Q4 profits, and posting record-breaking full year profits, the Interactive Media Group division continues to struggle.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Revenue for the fourth quarter - ending September 30 - was up 19 per cent year-on-year to $223 million. Operating losses decreased 10 per cent to $94 million.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Publisher Activision Blizzard saw stock drop to $13.02, a fall of 6.5 per cent, after recent financial results revealed falling subscription numbers for the MMO World Of Warcraft.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The drop was the largest since February 10, said  Bloomberg, despite Activision's record Q3 financial results.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Subscriptions to World Of Warcraft have fallen from 11.1 million to 10.3 million in just three months, athough a new expansion pack, Mists Of Pandaria, is expected to attract more users on release next year.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Valve has issued a statement detailing a hacking attempt which took down the Steam forums last week, but also penetrated the defences of a database holding passwords, plus billing, purchase, address and credit card information.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Passwords and credit card information was encrypted and Valve says that no evidence has come to light so far of any theft or misuse of details. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"We do not have evidence that encrypted credit card numbers or personally identifying information were taken by the intruders, or that the protection on credit card numbers or passwords was cracked," read a statement sent to Steam users by Valve boss Gabe Newell.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Anti-piracy measures are harming PC sales and customer loyalty, according to Good Old Games MD Guillaume Rambourg.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The company specialises in selling classic PC titles digitally, but he argued that DRM-free content also works on new releases, revealing that sales of The Witcher 2 were higher on GoG.com than they were on multiple digital services combined.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
While Steam helped the game sell 200,000 units, in the same time period the title sold just under 40,000 copies on GoG.com, but only 10,000 on other digital services combined - including Direct2Drive, Impulse and GamersGate.

									&lt;p&gt;
										The launch of a new Call of Duty game has been cemented into the industry's calendar as the focal point of the pre-Christmas season. So significant are the launch weekend sales of Activision's pillar franchise that they have come to be seen as a barometer for the health of the games business as a whole - not a fair or accurate assessment to make, but one which is simply too tempting for the mainstream media to drop.
									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										As such, the reporting of the launch of Modern Warfare 3 has focused heavily on sales of the game - which have been stellar, outstripping the launch sales of its predecessor and promising to become one of the biggest drivers of entertainment retail sales in the weeks leading up to Christmas. It's tempting to roll our eyes a little as the mainstream press once again breathlessly reports the long-established fact that rather a lot of people play video games now, but it doesn't exactly do any harm to have it reaffirmed in headlines.
									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										There's always a secondary story to accompany the launch of a Call of Duty game, though - one which often bubbles away in the background long after the headlines about sales figures and pictures of Z-list celebrities at launch parties have faded from media consciousness. Call of Duty is a game about war, terrorism and shooting a whole lot of people; it's always accompanied by some kind of controversy.
									&lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Saints Row publisher THQ isn't likely to survive the transition to a digital games business due to a lack of must-have games properties.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
That's according to more than 160 attendees of yesterday's London Games Conference, which included senior figures in publishing, development, social and mobile gaming, with over 70 per cent voting the company a 'zero' during a special interactive presentation.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The session, presented by Games Brief's Nicholas Lovell, also asked whether dedicated handheld consoles have a place in the gaming market going forward - more than 80 per cent of attendees agreed that they would not be able to compete with smartphones and other mobile devices offering multiple apps and services on top of games.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Publisher Take-Two has issued $200 million worth of senior convertible notes for purchase, a move which Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter believes could be used to raise funds for the acquisition of an other studio or company.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The notes, priced at $14.61 each by Take-Two and valued by Pachter at an estimated $19 each, will mature on June 1, 2016, with the publisher's accompanying statement indicating that the proceeds are for "general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and other strategic investments."

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Pachter observes that, as the company has a cash fund of $270 million, with a debt of $111 million due in 2016, the publisher does not need to raise operating capital. Add to that the expectation of two profitable coming quarters, and the recent announcement of GTA V and a picture emerges which could denote a sizeable outlay in the near future.

The release of Super Mario 3D Land caused 3DS sales to more than double in Japan last week.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
According to data from Media Create, reported by Andriasang, Mario's long awaited arrival on the 3DS generated 343,492 sales in the seven-day period ending November 6.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The success of Super Mario 3D Land reverberated in the performance of the 3DS, which sold 145,271 units - a huge improvement of the previous week's total of 65,041.

A new study that shows thanks to the rise of the smartphone, Apple and Android now has the largest share of the portable gaming market, ahead of traditional devices like the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
In statistics provided by analytics firm Flurry, iOS and Android had a 58 per cent share of the revenue from US portable game software. The Nintendo DS had only 36 per cent, with Sony's PSP trailing at just 6 per cent.

In 2009 mobile games took just 19 per cent of the market, rising to 34 per cent in 2010, while Nintendo has seen the opposite, falling from a dominant 70 per cent in 2009.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Brendan McNamara has revealed that he believes bad press and being too busy to arrange a new deal were the two contributing factors in Team Bondi's failure to sign another deal after L.A. Noire.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Speaking as part of an extensive interview with Eurogamer, his first since Team Bondi went under, McNamara claims that the studio was too busy to arrange a new deal until the project was finished - by which time bad press had made it impossible.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"Mainly, I'd say because we got a lot of bad press about what it was like to work with us and our conditions," he replied when asked why the studio hadn't been contracted once the Rockstar game was finished.

									&lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
According to internal e-mails obtained by AllThingsD, Mehdi will leave his current role as chief audience officer in the Online Services division due to the retirement of Mike Delman, the IEB's senior vice president of marketing. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"While there's never a great time to lose a valued leader, the time is right for Mike and the business to transition as we embark on our next journey to significantly grow our business in the next five years," said IEB president Don Mattrick of Delman.

German publisher Gamigo has bought a 20.1 per cent stake in Korean free-to-play developer OnsOn Soft.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The Seoul-based studio, formed in 2004, employs over 60 members of staff and created MMORPG Fiesta Online, already published by Gamigo.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"We've had a close business relationship with OnsOn Soft for years; this step will cement that further," commented Patrick Streppel, one of Gamigo's board members.

									&lt;p&gt;
										Sometimes, in our industry, there's a little too much PR. Too many layers of obfusication between developers and consumers, giving everything a sort of beige tint - albeit polished to shiny perfection. Because of that, it's brilliant, especially for journalists, when you meet someone who's not afraid to speak their minds, someone like Sean Murray.
									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										However, there's a good reason that people employ PR reps. Sometimes, honesty can go a bit too far. Things can be taken out of context, quotations misconstrued. Sometimes people change their minds.
									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										But when a promising indie developer, who has had great success on a platform, calls that platform's main rival "a slaughterhouse" there seems little margin for error and few roads back.

Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, believes Google are trying to build their own version of the popular networking site.

									&lt;/p&gt;

He revealed his thoughts in an interview on American TV show Charlie Rose, while speaking about Facebook's relationships with other large online companies. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"Google, I think, in some ways, is more competitive and certainly is trying to build their own little version of Facebook," he said.

WildTangent has launched an app service which allows users to rent or buy Android games from a tightly curated selection of the 13,000 titles available on the system.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The service takes games from many of the platform's biggest publishers and presents them in a way designed to deal with one of the biggest problems for Android developers: discoverability.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"Just like movies and music, consumers prefer to own some titles, rent some and watch some for free, and we've brought these same options to games," said Wild Tangent senior VP Sean Vanderdasson.

Subscriptions to the popular fantasy RPG World of Warcraft have dropped by 800,000, from 11.1 million three months ago to 10.3 million.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
In a conference call to discuss Activision's third quarter sales figures, Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime suggested that the biggest losses were being seen in China.

He then added that World Of Warcraft is "one of the most popular online games in China, and remains by far the most popular subscription-based MMO in the world."

Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot believes that software is the key to improving the fortunes of the Nintendo 3DS.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Speaking to Edge Online at the Montreal International Games Summit, Guillemot supported Nintendo's decision to cut the price of the handheld, but expressed doubt over it being enough to stimulate growth. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"I think it's a question of coming with enough games [more] than the price. For sure the price was too high and it was a big boost when they changed it, it really was a good idea," he said.

									&lt;p&gt;
										In the first of a series of regular articles, James Brightman, editor-in-chief of our sister site IndustryGamers.com, breaks down the Madden phenomenon, how it dominates US leisure time and has earned its place in American pop culture. 
									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Football. The very utterance of the word elicits strong feelings from sports fans on both sides of the Atlantic, but we're talking about two vastly different sports. While the rest of the world gets their literal kicks out of what we Americans (rightfully) call soccer, professional football in America is as big a business as it gets. During the late summer, millions of Americans get psyched for the fall NFL season. A good percentage of these fans immerse themselves in the action through one of America's favourite video game franchises: Madden. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The very first John Madden Football was released back in 1988, and for more than 20 years now, the franchise has built up one of the most passionate fan followings imaginable. The series has sold 95 million units worldwide and generated over $3 billion in revenues for EA. It's also a very American franchise, with 90 per cent of sales or more coming from this side of the Atlantic. 

									&lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;p&gt;
										
After the months of aggressive marketing, week one sales suggest that the biggest battle in video games is perhaps over before it has really begun. Based on week one figures, the stark reality is that EA's Battlefield has sold less than a quarter of the amount of units shifted by Call of Duty: Black Ops last year - meaning it would require a monumental drop-off in sales performance for MW3 to be in any way comparable. The biggest video game face-off of the year appears to have concluded with a whimper rather than a bang.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Doubtless, EA will be taking heart from the fact that it doubled its sales year-on-year in comparison with Medal of Honor, and blitzed its previous totals from all previous Battlefield releases, but it's clear that despite the trash talk and the enormous marketing budgets, it's going to take a catastrophic failure on Activision's part not to once again achieve sales domination with Modern Warfare 3. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
But what of the respective merits of the games themselves? From a product development point of view, how does the new DICE epic rate against (take a deep breath) Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer and Raven's collaboration? 

									&lt;/p&gt;

Red Dead Redemption publisher Take-Two reported losses of $47.3 million for the second quarter, down from the $8 million profit for the same period last year.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Revenues were also down to $107 million from $245 million in 2011, from sales of catalogue and digital content. Digital accounted for 25 per cent of revenues during the three month period, driven by GTA, Borderlands, Red Dead Redemption and Sid Meier's Civilization.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"Our second quarter results exceeded expectations, driven by strong demand for the company's catalogue offerings and digitally delivered add-on content that deepens the consumer experience," offered Strauss Zelnick, chairman and CEO of Take-Two.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Activision has announced record third quarter sales for the period ended September 30, driven by a 57 per cent increase in digital sales.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Of the third quarter revenues, digital channels accounted for $427 million of the total $754 million in sales. For the year to date, sales of digital products account for $1.28 billion, or 25 per cent of business. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Profit for the third quarter was up considerably, from $51 million to $148 million. The company now expects calendar year sales of $4.33 billion compared to previous estimates of $4.18 billion, and Q4 revenues of $980 million in the month it launched Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops sold nearly 15 million units in the US from the start of the 2010 year until September 2011, according to NPD data.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The game, released in November 2010, tops the best-selling list in the region, with sales that separate it from its closest competitor, Ubisoft's Just Dance 2, by almost 10 million units.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
EA's Madden NFL 11 was just behind Just Dance 2 with 5.24 million and 5.19 million sales respectively, while Microsoft's Halo: Reach was at 4.74 million units.

									&lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Ubisoft has filed a half-yearly financial report which exceeds sales expectations and trims losses, with revenues of €248.5 million and a loss of €37.1 million, an improvement on losses of €89.8 million for the same period last year.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The sales figure exceeds the publisher's forecast by over 30 per cent, reflecting a huge gain of 85 per cent for the company's online business. Overall sales forecasts for the full year remain unchanged at between €1,040 million and €1,080 million.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"First-half sales have come in around 30 per cent higher than our initial targets," said CEO Yves Guillemot. 

									&lt;/p&gt;

The South Korean online gaming company Nexon is planning its initial public offering on the Tokyo Stock Exchange next month.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
According to Japanese business paper The Nikkei, reported by TechCrunch, Nexon is targeting a valuation of ¥100 billion ($1.3b/£800m).

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
If accurate, that would make Nexon the most valuable IPO in Japan this year. It will be handled by Nomura Securities, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, with Nexon expected to be approved for the listing by the end of the week.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Yves Guillemot claims that the Wii still represents almost half of Ubisoft's total business.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Speaking to Gamasutra, Ubisoft's CEO explained that the console's falling sales didn't necessarily mean that some third-party companies aren't making money.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"Today, the Wii still is 45 percent of our business," he said. "Just Dance, all those casual games, are selling extremely well."

Best Buy will close its UK Big Box consumer electronics stores, Internet Retailing reports.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The US retail giant has 11 Big Box stores in the UK, all of which will close before the end of the year, costing the company an estimated £25m to £30m and a further £40m to £45m in asset write downs.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
A consultation period with affected staff has already begun, and could potentially delay the final closing date into 2012.

Middleware giant Autodesk has acquired certain staff and technological assets from Montreal-based game AI specialist GRIP Entertainment.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
No exact details of the deal were disclosed by either party, but a statement on Autodesk's blog indicates that the technological resources relate closely to AI behaviour trees and decision making.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"Behaviour trees offer programmers, designers and even producers a mechanism to communicate design concepts and debate implementation options, resulting in less rework and iteration," reads the statement. 
"Moreover the design itself is mirrored in the actual code implementation, limiting the AI programmer's need to interpret the design.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Sony's corporate credit rating has been downgraded by finance company Standard and Poor's, with the group citing the lack of a likely recovery for the company's core business in the near future.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The company is now rated A- for long term borrowing and A-2 for short term loans. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"The CreditWatch listing is based on our view that the likelihood of Sony's weak earnings persisting has increased as there are no signs of a halt to the deterioration in the earnings of the company's core flat panel TV business," read a statement from the company.

In a set of buildings in rural Oxfordshire you'll find a team of people who are quietly changing lives. Helping a small girl who can't move play table tennis, providing the equipment that allows a man with a degenerative condition to spend his last days at home and making it possible for a father and son to play a game together for the first time.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
That's what makes it hard to sum up what Special Effect do in any sort of concise way: their motto is "whatever it takes". Essentially, they improve the lives of the ill and disabled by giving them access to technology and software that allows them to play, express themselves and in some cases even communicate.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Gaming can seem like a pastime, rather than an essential part of life, but for a small child entirely paralysed, unable to speak, video games may be their only way to play. And, as founder Dr Mick Donegan points out, that's as important as any other part of their care and rehabilitation.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Square Enix has recorded a six month profit of ¥3.7 billion, in line with a recently increased forecast. The figure is more than double last year's total of ¥1.7 billion for the same period.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Sales for the half year were ¥57.5 billion, actually a slight reduction from the ¥68 billion for the same six month period last year. EPS for the period was ¥32.13.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Square Enix recently doubled it's profit forecast, a prediction which these results met almost exactly. The profit forecast for the full year now stands at ¥5 billion.

Zynga has filed an SEC document which shows its quarterly revenues to be at record highs, but shows profits to have dwindled since the same period last year. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The extensive document, pertaining to the company's forthcoming IPO, shows that sales have reached an all time high of $306.8 million at the social publisher, but profits are down to $12.5 million compared to the $42.9 million for the same quarter last year. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The largest cost increase at the company has been in research and development, rising from $39.7 million to $49.8 million since the same period in 2010.

Social publisher GLU has reported quarterly losses of $6.2 million, more than triple that for the same period last year.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The figure comes alongside a slightly increased revenue of $16.9 million, up from $15.5 million for the 2010 quarter.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
That increase in sales reflects a huge growth in the company's smartphone business, which has grown by 306 per cent year-on-year.

Konami has made profits of ¥11.5 billion for the first six months of its current financial year, ending September 30, 2011.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The numbers show a huge jump in profits year-on-year, from just ¥4.2 billion for the same period last year, whilst sales remained relatively stable at ¥123.1 billion, up slightly from last year's ¥115.8 billion. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The prediction for full-year sales is a total of ¥258 billion.

									&lt;/p&gt;

				 Stock Ticker: Sony</title><link>http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-07-stock-ticker-sony-article</link><pubDate>07 November 2011 06:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-07-stock-ticker-sony-article</guid><description>
									&lt;p&gt;
										
What we used to call a "rough few years" for Sony is rapidly on its way to becoming a rough decade - and it's only getting rougher. Last week's financial reports were nothing short of absolutely dreadful - the small loss (¥1.6 billion) is nothing to cheer about, but is overshadowed by the much more worrying decline in sales, which dropped nearly 10 per cent to ¥1.5 trillion. 

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Forecasts imply that that 10 per cent drop in sales is unlikely to recover in the near future, while profits are expected to continue to languish down around the break-even point. It's not quite catastrophic stuff, at first glance - the company isn't haemorrhaging cash, at least - but when you consider that this is meant to be the tail end of CEO Sir Howard Stringer's far-reaching reforms to get Sony back on track, suddenly everything looks rather bleak.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The problem with assessing Sony, of course, is that what we're really interested in is only one division of the company - the PlayStation business. Dividing that business off from the rest of the company is tricky, especially when it comes to stock market movements, and it's especially difficult now that the PlayStation business is bundled with the LCD television business as part of the Consumer Products and Services division.

									&lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;p&gt;
										
LEGO is to close down its recently launched MMO this January following failure to generate enough subscribers.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The company's Play Well Studios in Louisville and marketing team in Denmark will be axed, affecting 115 employees.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
LEGO Universe launched in 2010 after a protracted development, but in February this year the company bought the majority of the development team and the rights to the game from developer NetDevil. It then proceeded to lay off members of staff.

									&lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;p&gt;
										
Industry fund raising body GamesAid has named the six charities which will benefit from its patronage this year, with each scheme receiving a cheque for £29,000 each - a 74 per cent increase on last year's total.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The charities which garnered the most votes from GamesAid members in the recent round of voting were: Action for Kids, which provides essential equipment to improve the lives of disabled children; Jigsaw4u, which focuses on helping traumatised children recover and re-engage with their environments and Lifelites, which helps to entertain and care for terminally ill young people in hospices.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Special Effect, which prototypes and builds technology which enables the handicapped to enjoy videogames was also selected for funding, as were child support service MAPS and The Willow Foundation, which takes seriously ill children on field trips and days out.

									&lt;/p&gt;

				 Hello Games: Porting Joe Danger to XBLA was "cathartic"</title><link>http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-04-hello-games-porting-joe-danger-to-xbla-was-cathartic</link><pubDate>04 November 2011 11:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-04-hello-games-porting-joe-danger-to-xbla-was-cathartic</guid><description>
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Sean Murray, head of Joe Danger developer Hello Games says that the revisiting the game in order to bring it to XBLA was a cathartic process, meaning the team was able to iron out the kinks and make the game better.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz in an interview to be published next week, Murray said that stats and data collected from watching hundreds of thousands of PS3 players enjoy the game had helped the team to polish a game which they felt was released to PSN "because we'd run out of money."

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"We loved the game, the original Joe Danger," Murray explained. "But we'd released it just because we kind of ran out of money, we didn't really feel like it was finished. I don't think most teams would feel this way, but we actually jumped at the chance to revisit it and fix everything that was wrong.

Activision's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is expected to generated revenues of $1.1 billion in its first six weeks.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
That's according to Wedbush Morgan's Michael Pachter, who suggested the game will sell 10 per cent more than previous title Black Ops.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Pachter also estimated that the Call of Duty Elite premium service could pull in up to 4 million subscribers by the end of the year.

Since going free-to-play earlier this week, Sony Online Entertainment's DC Universe has picked up an extra 120,000 registrations on PC.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
That's according to SOE boss John Smedley, who also noted that concurrent users are up by four times as much. To increase take up, the company is also planning a big TV and online advertising push this month.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
DC Universe Online for both PC and PlayStation 3 is the latest massively multiplayer game to go free-to-play after originally launching with a subscription model.

									&lt;p&gt;
										
In the midst of the rolling debate about the entire future of the games industry and its business models, a fascinating figure emerged this week - although its significance was, perhaps, not entirely evident at first glance. Never mind financial results from social game operators or layoffs at mobile developers or profit forecasts at boxed game publishers; this week, From Software's Dark Souls announced hitting a shipment milestone of 1.5 million units worldwide.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
This is an important figure on a few levels. It's important for fans of the game, of course, who can be happy in the knowledge that commercial success ensures future development along similar lines. It's important for From Software and for overseas publisher Namco Bandai for similar reasons - but it's important to the industry as a whole because it's something which, according to the prevailing conventional wisdom, shouldn't have happened.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Dark Souls, for the uninitiated, is a deeply unforgiving yet superbly well-tuned action RPG, set in a dark fantasy world and focused heavily on the intricacies of character development and tuning, as well as the building up of player skill. It's best known for a steep difficulty curve which ensures that players will die many, many times, and for punishing harshly for those deaths. It doesn't feature bombastic FPS set-pieces, cinematic quick-time events, perfectly rendered glistening sportsmen or motion-controlled mini-games. It's a game which has "Noble Failure" stamped all over it from the outset.

									&lt;/p&gt;

German online browser company Gameforge is to axe 100 of its 450 employees.

Final Fantasy Type-0 held off competition from Kirby Wii and Idolmaster 2 to take top spot in the Japanese software chart.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
According to data from Media Create, reported by Andriasang, Square Enix's PSP title sold 472,253 units in the week ending October 30, comfortably ahead of Kirby's 136,811 units and Idolmaster 2's 65,512 units.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The hardware chart showed very little movement, with the 3DS holding on to the top spot despite falling by more than 8,000 sales from last week's total of 73,933.

"The markets are different around the world for the business models with which you can ship an MMO,," he said.

Social games and media company RockYou is shedding around 50 per cent of staff, according to new reports.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
As part of the move, the company will sell recent acquisition Playdemic back to its founders, states Tech Crunch, with the developer keeping its game Gourmet Ranch.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Manchester's Playdemic was only acquired at the start of this year, at a time when RockYou was pushing to become a name in social gaming.

Mobile publisher Gameloft reported sales of €40.6 million for the third quarter, up 21 per cent on the same period last year.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
For the nine months of the financial year sales stand at €117.4 million, up 18 per cent.

Europe represented 29 per cent of the company's sales during the third quarter, North America 28 per cent, with the remaining sales split across the rest of the world.

Mobage, the Android gaming network developed by DeNA, has completed its global beta phase, the company reports.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
The service has existed in a lesser form in DeNA's Japanese operations for some time, but the company has leveraged the influence of ngmoco, which it acquired last year, to introduce the service to the west and expand its market.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
"Mobage has come out of beta," said ngmoco CEO Neil Young. 

									&lt;/p&gt;

				 THQ records quarterly loss of $92.4m, sales of $146m</title><link>http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-03-thq-records-quarterly-loss-of-USD92-4m-sales-of-USD146m</link><pubDate>03 November 2011 08:18 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-11-03-thq-records-quarterly-loss-of-USD92-4m-sales-of-USD146m</guid><description>
									&lt;p&gt;
										
THQ has reported a loss of $92.4 million for the quarter ending 30 September, 2011, alongside revenues of $146 million, resulting in a loss per share of $1.32.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
Both the sales and the loss figures are double what they were at the same time last year, when sales were $77.1 million and the bottom line was a loss of $46.9 million.

									&lt;/p&gt;									
								
									&lt;p&gt;
										
This quarter, sales were predominantly driven by Warhammer 40K: Space Marine and the company's uDraw tablet for Wii. For the future, expectations lay heavy on the shoulders of the Autumn's Saints Row: the Third, which THQ expects to net it a record quarter. 

									&lt;/p&gt;
